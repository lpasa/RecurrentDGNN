## Abstract

Graph Neural Networks (GNN) show good results in classification and regression on graphs, notwithstanding most GNN models use a limited depth. In fact, they are composed of only a few stacked graph convolutional layers. One reason for this is the number of parameters growing with the number of GNN layers. In this paper, we show how using a recurrent graph convolution layer can help in building deeper GNNs, without increasing the complexity of the training phase, while improving on the predictive performances. We also analyze how the depth of the model influences the final result.
